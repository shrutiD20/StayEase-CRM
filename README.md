# StayEase-CRM
StayEase CRM is a Salesforce-powered rental and accommodation CRM platform, inspired by Airbnb but tailored for both short-term tourism and long-term student/professional housing.

# Problem Statement
Managing accommodations for diverse groups such as tourists, students, and working professionals is often challenging due to fragmented platforms and lack of personalization.
-Tourists & Travelers need short-term stays with flexibility.
-Students & Professionals require long-term, affordable, and reliable housing like PGs, hostels, or rentals. Traditional property management systems lack centralized communication, efficient booking handling, transparent ratings/reviews, and host‚Äìguest coordination. This results in:
‚Ä¢ Inefficient property discovery
‚Ä¢ Lack of trust between host and guest
‚Ä¢ Manual management of payments & complaints
‚Ä¢ Limited visibility of guest/host performance
StayEase CRM solves these issues by creating a Salesforce-powered centralized platform for property management, booking, guest handling, and payments.

## Industry Type
‚Ä¢ B2C (Business-to-Consumer): StayEase directly connects property hosts with end-users (tourists, students, working professionals).
Target Users
1. Hosts ‚Äì Individuals or businesses listing their properties.
2. Guests ‚Äì Tourists, students, or professionals booking stays.
3. Admins ‚Äì Oversee operations, resolve disputes, and manage CRM functionalities.
